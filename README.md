# Postfix Arithmetic Expression Evaluator made using Stack Data Structure

PROJECT STATEMENT :    Arithmetic Expression Evaluator is a project built keeping in mind to solve the difficulty we face while solving complex postfix expressions which even a scientific calculator cannot solve.   

PROPOSED SOLUTION :   Postfix expressions are the arithmetic expressions in which the operand precedes the operator. These expressions are solved by creating a stack table and while solving most of them are moderate in difficulty level. But there can be cases where expressions can be too tedious and difficult to solve just like some scientific calculations. In such a case, this project can turn out to be a really helpful tool.

Algorithm

Use a stack, assume binary operators +, *
Input: postfix expression
Scan the input
If operand,
 	push to stack
If operator 
Pop the stack twice
Apply operator
Push result back to stack



CONCLUSION :

This project of Arithmetic Expression Evaluator is an inspiration from the Scientific Calculators we use i.e. to solve the problems too hard for an average student.
