# PostfixArithmeticExpressionEvaluator_SY
PROJECT STATEMENT :    Arithmetic Expression Evaluator is a project built keeping in mind to solve the difficulty we face while solving complex postfix expressions which even a scientific calculator cannot solve.    PROPOSED SOLUTION :   Postfix expressions are the arithmetic expressions in which the operand precedes the operator. These expressions are solved by creating a stack table and while solving most of them are moderate in difficulty level. But there can be cases where expressions can be too tedious and difficult to solve just like some scientific calculations. In such a case, this project can turn out to be a really helpful tool.
